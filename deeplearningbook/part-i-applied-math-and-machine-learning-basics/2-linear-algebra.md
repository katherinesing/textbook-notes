1. scalar - a number. *s*. Let *s* an element of all real numbers be the slope of the line.
2. vector - an array. ***x***. It has n rows and 1 column. It can be written as a column of elements enclosed in square brackets.
3. matrix - a 2-D matrix. ***A***. Height m and width n (m rows and n columns). ***A***<sub>1,1</sub> is uppermost leftmost entry, and ***A***<sub>m, n</sub> is bottommost rightmost entry.
4. tensor - array with >2 axes. **A**<sub>i,j,k</sub>
5. transpose, such as for matrix ***A***, ***A***<sup>T</sup>- the mirror image of a matrix along the "main diagonal" (diagonal starting top left, going down and right). A<sub>i,j</sub> = A<sup>T</sup><sub>j,i</sub>. So a standard column vector can thus be written as the transpose of an inline single row matrix.
