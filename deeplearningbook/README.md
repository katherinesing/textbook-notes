At the end of 2025, I slowly began studying for SWE interviews again and \
browsing job openings for a role in software engineering after taking a planned \
career break. At the same time, I was curious if there were free resources for \
me to actively learn about machine learning when I found the [Open AI interview guide](https://openai.com/interview-guide/) \
which listed this [Deep Learning Book](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/). The book introduction seemed inviting \
and friendly enough for me, and it mentioned that it was for university students \
learning about machine learning and software engineers who do not have a machine \
learning or statistics background but want to learn and use deep learning in \
their product. Both of which, at this point, I am kindof a used-to-be, has-been. I am \
doubly aspiring!

The next chapter of DLB is about linear algebra, which I learned in high school \
and/or university, though it is all too blurry. I hope to take notes on this chapter \
at least to keep track of progress.
